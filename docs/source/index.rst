   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Matrioshka's documentation!
======================================

Matrioshka is a comprehensive deployment solution built on top of
Fabric. Think of it as the mother brain that knows where everything
goes. 

You start with a simple declarative syntax and then customize
with event hooks. Everything is just python syntax, and if you know
Fabric, then you know Matrioshka. 

For a quick introduction, see the :ref:`quick-start guide
